# Churn-Prediction-Using-KNIME-Tool

### Churn prediction:
Churn prediction modelling techniques attempt to understand the precise customer behaviours and attributes which signal the risk and timing of customer churn. Churn prediction is the use of statistics and data about your customers to try to model who might leave for another service. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. The companies are interested in identifying segments of these customers because the price for acquiring a new customer is usually higher than retaining the old one.

### What is KNIME Analytics Platform?
